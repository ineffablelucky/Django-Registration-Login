I used a YouTube Tutorial, to learn how to create urls.py file for each django app in my project. In this way, i can easily between apps urls during debugging and development. Earlier i just used one main urls.py file.

Django documentation is the major source of this project and it makes registraion and login.logout process really easy. 

This project is only half done and right now only below mentioned features work:
1. Registration of new user
2. Login/Logout
3. Profile page + Edit profile feature
4. Forgot/Reset password via email
5. Change password
6. Restricted access for logged-out user.
